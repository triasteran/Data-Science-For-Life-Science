<b>The central limit theorem</b> states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed with mean <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu">  and standard mean error <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=se = \sigma / sqrt(n)"> (standard mean error is just a stadard deviation for sample means distribution).
